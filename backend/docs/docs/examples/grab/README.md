# Grab Interactions Example


This example demonstrates various grab interaction techniques in WebXR using the Immersive Web SDK (IWSDK). Experience different ways to grab and interact with 3D objects in VR using controllers or hand tracking.


## Overview


This example showcases three distinct grab interaction patterns:


- **One-Hand Grabbing**: Pick up and move objects with a single hand
- **Two-Hand Grabbing**: Grab objects with both hands to move and resize them
- **Distance Grabbing**: Pull distant objects toward you using ray casting

## Quick Start


### Prerequisites


- Node.js 20.19.0+ 
- HTTPS-capable development environment


### Installation


```bash
cd immersive-web-sdk/examples/grab
npm install
```


### Development


```bash
# Start development server with HTTPS
npm run dev


# Build for production
npm run build


# Preview production build
npm run preview
```


The development server will start at `https://localhost:8081` with automatic HTTPS certificates.


## Implementation Details


### Main Application (src/index.js)


The application initializes a WebXR world with the following key features:


```javascript
World.create(document.getElementById('scene-container'), {
  assets,
  xr: {
    sessionMode: SessionMode.ImmersiveVR,
    requiredFeatures: ['hand-tracking'],
  },
  level: '/glxf/Composition.glxf',
  features: {
    grabbing: true,
  },
});
```


### Grabbable Component


The core of this example is the `Grabbable` component, which provides interaction patterns of 3D objects. More details can be found in https://iwsdk.dev/concepts/grabbing/interaction-types.html



## Customization


### Adding New Grabbable Objects In Meta Spatial Editor


1. Make sure your local dev server is running with `npm run dev`
1. Open the `grab/metaspatial/Main.metaspatial` file in Meta Spatial Editor
1. Create or import 3D models in the Editor
1. Add the `Grabbable` component to entities based on the expected grab type (GrabSystem doesn't support adding multiple Grabbable components to one entity)
1. Save the Editor file and the local dev server will automatically refresh with the updated scene


## Troubleshooting


### Objects Won't Grab
- Ensure `grabbing: true` in World config
- Verify Grabbable component is present on entities



### Build Issues
- Run `npm run fresh:build` for clean rebuild
- Check that all IWSDK packages are properly linked
