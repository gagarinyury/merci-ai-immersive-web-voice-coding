# Archive Directory

This directory stores VR objects that were removed from the active scene.

## Purpose

- **Preserve work**: Objects are archived instead of deleted
- **Reuse later**: Restore archived objects to the scene
- **Scene management**: Keep scene clean while preserving assets

## Structure

Each cleared scene creates a timestamped folder:
```
archive/
├── scene-2025-12-07-10-30/
│   ├── red-cube.ts
│   └── blue-sphere.ts
└── scene-2025-12-07-11-45/
    └── portal.ts
```

## Commands

**Clear scene** - "clear scene", "clean scene", "remove all objects"
- Moves all files from `src/generated/` to `src/archive/scene-{timestamp}/`

**Restore object** - "restore red cube", "bring back portal"
- Copies file from archive back to `src/generated/`

**List archive** - "what's in archive?", "show archived objects"
- Shows all archived files organized by timestamp
